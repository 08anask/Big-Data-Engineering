```

set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict; 
set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;
```
Now insert the data into the parted and bucketed table from the violations parking table
```

where year(Issue_Date) = '2017';
```
## Part-I: Examine the data

### 1. Find the total number of tickets for the year.
```
select count(distinct Summons_Number) Tickets_Total ,year(Issue_Date) as year from park_viol_part_buck group by year(Issue_Date);
```
5432898  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2017

### 2. Find out how many unique states the cars which got parking tickets came from.
```
select count(distinct Registration_State) as No_of_States from park_viol_part_buck;
select Registration_State, Count(1) as Number_of_Records from park_viol_part_buck  group by Registration_State order by Number_of_Records;
```
65

### 3. Some parking tickets donâ€™t have addresses on them, which is cause for concern. Find out how many such tickets there are(i.e. tickets where either "Street Code 1" or "Street Code 2" or "Street Code 3" is empty )
```
select count(distinct summons_number) as No_Tickets_without_address from violations_parking  where Street_code1 = 0 or Street_code2 = 0 or Street_code3 = 0;
```
3667515

## Part-II: Aggregation tasks

### 1.How often does each violation code occur? (frequency of violation codes - find the top 5)
```
select count(Violation_Code) as frequency_of_violation,Violation_Code from park_viol_part_buck group by Violation_Code order by frequency_of_violation desc limit 5;
```
768276 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21<br>

476756 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14<br>
319720 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20<br>

### 2. How often does each vehicle body type get a parking ticket? How about the vehicle make? (find the top 5 for both)
```
select Vehicle_Body_Type,count(summons_number)as frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket  from park_viol_part_buck group by Vehicle_Body_Type order by frequency_of_getting_parking_ticket desc limit 5;
```
